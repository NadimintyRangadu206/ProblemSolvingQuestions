/**
 * Problem statement Ninja is shifting to a new place named NinjaGram. To take
 * admission to the new school, the teacher gives him a sentence and asks him to
 * check whether the sentence is a pangram.
 * 
 * A word or a sentence is called a pangram if it contains all the English
 * alphabet letters.
 * 
 * Since Ninja is new to programming, he doesn’t have much experience; he asks
 * you to solve the problem. Can you help Ninja figure out whether the sentence
 * is a pangram?
 * 
 * Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images ) Constraints: 1<=
 * T <= 50 1<= n <= 10^4
 * 
 * 
 * Where ’T’ is the number of test cases, ‘n’ denotes the number of characters
 * in the string.
 * 
 * Time Limit: 1 sec Sample Input 1: 2 12 toosmallword 35
 * TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog Sample Output 1: NO YES Explanation for
 * Sample Input 1: In the first test case, the given string is “toosmallword”
 * which contains the characters [‘t’,’o’,’s’,’m’,’a’,’l’,’w’,’r’,’d’], which
 * doesn’t contain all the 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is “NO”.
 * 
 * 
 * In the second test case, the given string is
 * “TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog” which contains the characters:
 * [‘t’,’h’,’e’,’q’,’u’,’i’,’c’,’k’,’b’,’r’,’o’,’w’,’n’,’f’,’x’,’j’,’m’,’p,’’s’,’v’,’l,’a’,’z’,’y’,’
 * d’,’g’], which contains all the 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is
 * “YES”. Sample Input 2:
 * 
 * 2 16 CodingNinjas 10 CodeStudio Sample Output 2: NO NO Explanation for Sample
 * Input 2: In the first test case, the given string is “CodingNinjas” which
 * contains the characters [‘c’,’o’,’d’,’i’,’n’,’g’,’i’,’j’,’a’,’s’], which
 * doesn’t contain all the 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is “NO”.
 * 
 * 
 * In the first test case, the given string is “CodeStudio” which contains the
 * characters [‘c’,’o’,’d’,’e’,’s’,’t’,’u’,’i’], which doesn’t contain all the
 * 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is “NO”.
